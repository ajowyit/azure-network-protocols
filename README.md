<h1>Network Security Groups (NSGs) and Inspecting Traffic Between Azure Virtual Machines</h1>
In this project, we explore network traffic between two Azure Virtual Machines using Wireshark and PowerShell. We analyze communication patterns to better understand how data flows within a virtual network. Additionally, we demonstrate how to configure Network Security Groups (NSGs) to control inbound and outbound traffic, showcasing how they enhance the security and management of cloud-based resources. <br />

<img width="1500" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-26 at 11 32 17‚ÄØPM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/984cc7f0-1126-4ae8-899d-04ab8b0eba08" />

</p>
<p>
- Log into your Azure account. Navigate to Virtual Machines. Start the virtual machines if they are not already on/running. Select both virtual machines by checking the box and then click the "Start" button. Azure will ask, "Do you want to start all the selected VMs?" Click "Yes". Make sure to take note of the Public IP for the windows-vm.
</p>

<p>
- You'll need to wait a bit for the virtual machines to be up and running. Make sure that the virtual machines are be up and running before moving on by checking Status.
</p>
<br />

<p>

</p>

<p>
- Open Remote Desktop (Windows) or the Windows App (MacOS). For this walkthrough, I'm using the Windows App because I have a Mac. The Windows App can be found in the App Store and downloaded from there. Once you open the Windows App, click the "+" button at the top right. Then, select "Add PC" from the dropdown options.
</p>
<br />
<p>
 <img width="521" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-26 at 11 40 06‚ÄØPM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/33bb040e-a18c-4d64-b3f2-bf033b6f067d" />

 </p>
<p>
- Enter the Public IP address for the windows virtual machine that we took note of earlier in "PC name".  If you forgot to take note of it, go back to Azure and locate it on the main Virtual Machines page. For Friendly name, I used "windows-vm" for clarity and simplicity. Click "Add".   
</p>
<br />

<p>
 <img width="1000" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-26 at 11 50 12‚ÄØPM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9f591580-8189-404c-9645-655d5a06db45" />
</p>

<p>
- Enter the Username and Password for the windows-vm that we created in Azure. Click "Continue".
</p>
<br />


<p>
- Now we're connected to the windows-vm in Azure from our Home Lab using RDP! Open the virtual machine's browser, "Microsoft Edge". Go to www.wireshark.org to dowload Wireshark on the virtual machine using default settings. We will use this Wireshark to observe network traffic with various protocols.
</p>
<br />

<p>
<img width="1700" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-27 at 12 17 24‚ÄØAM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1fad2c2d-e7af-4740-819c-6f3c349a1dc0" />

<img width="1500" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-27 at 12 23 20‚ÄØAM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9280aa79-53d0-4711-a228-2febd0b08995" />

</p>


<p>
- Once on Wireshark's website, select "Windows x64 Installer" to download the installer .exe file. Then go to your downloads, open the file and finish the Wireshark setup. Keep clicking "Next" and "Finish" until you complete the setup.
</p>
<br />

<h3>Step 2: Observe the ICMP Traffic</h3>
<p>
 <img width="748" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-27 at 12 51 32‚ÄØAM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0eb44072-f0cb-4b90-a0bd-2127481970a8" />
</p>

<p>
- Open Wireshark. 
- Make sure "Ethernet" is highlighted
- Click on the shark fin in the top left of the screen to start capturing network traffic.
</p>
<br />

<p>
<img width="751" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-27 at 1 20 11‚ÄØAM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ba9ce63a-1d85-4ff3-b888-0743e1c38fbb" />
<img width="750" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-27 at 12 54 52‚ÄØAM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/db9412a1-8ee4-4ca9-ac15-3b06298df572" />
</p>
  
<p>
- We can see all the traffic running over the network in the purple shaded area.
</p>

<p>
- At the Filter Bar at the top of the srceen, type "icmp" and press enter or click the arrow icon to apply the filter. 
</p>

<p>
- We will use the icmp filter to isolate ICMP traffic.
</p>
<br />

<p>
 <img width="1500" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-27 at 1 23 53‚ÄØAM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e6767870-7e44-4ea1-b80d-5409a4e13a38" />
</p>

<p>
- In Azure, select the linux-vm and click Networking to find the Private IP address. It should be 10.0.0.5. Go back to the windows-vm.
</p>
<br />

<p>
 <img width="796" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-27 at 1 29 27‚ÄØAM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c7c893a2-1392-4182-8953-fe82293379ba" />
</p>

<p>
- On the windows virtual machine, click the Windows button at the bottom left of you screen. Search for PowerShell and open it. We are going to use commands in PowerShell to ping the linux-vm from the windows-vm.
</p>
<br />

<p>
<img width="1583" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-27 at 1 50 04‚ÄØAM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0cf8cc2d-3a44-48d6-add3-53fb4587b405" />

 <img width="1567" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-27 at 1 55 15‚ÄØAM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c6ea52c-f098-4433-85a2-12e8af4cff04" />

</p>

<p>
- In PowerShell, enter the command ping 10.0.0.5 to ping the linux-vm. Since the icmp filter is active in Wireshark, we will only seeing icmp traffic over the network. This lets us see our windows virtual machine (10.0.0.4) send the request to the linux virtual machine (10.0.0.5) and the linux virtual machine send a reply back to the winows-vm. We have just successfully tested the connection between the two virtual machines.  
</p>

<p>
- Next, in PowerShell, initiate a perpetual ping to the linux-vm by entering the command ping 10.0.0.5 -t. This tells the windows virtual machine to ping the linux virtual machine non-stop. Observe all of that traffic
</p>
<br />

<h3>Step 3: Use a Network Security Group (NSG) firewall to deny ping</h3>
<p>
<img width="1500" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-27 at 2 45 55‚ÄØPM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a5c3cab7-69b1-464a-8c29-8dbf995b9545" />
</p>

<p>
- Now we will explore Network Securiy Group functions and set a new security rule for the linux-vm. In Vitural Machines, click the linux-vm, select Network settings, and then click "linux-vm-nsg" under Network security group.
</p>
<br />

<p>
<img width="1500" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-27 at 2 49 26‚ÄØPM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/52473a99-38e2-4d1f-a27b-51b9154f631f" />
</p>

<p>
- Next, select Inbound security rules. Click the "+Add" button to create a new rule. We are going to tell the Firewall to Deny inbound traffic to the linux-vm from ping. Change Source to "Any". Make sure there's an asterisk in both port ranges (asterisk = all). Select "ICMPv4" for the Protocol since ping uses ICMPv4. For Action, select "Deny". Change the Priority to "290" which will make our new rule first priority. Finally, add the rule to the NSG by clicking the "Add" button.
</p>
<br />

<p>
<img width="1500" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-27 at 3 01 48‚ÄØPM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/64155970-dd23-4287-a632-79f929bebf13" />
</p>

<p>
- Now our new Security Rule has been created. Go back to the windows-vm.
</p>
<br />

<p>
 <img width="1498" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-27 at 3 28 58‚ÄØPM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c56c64e5-94c4-4c9d-abee-c1cd08e65432" />
</p>

<p>
- Observe how the ping request(s) time out in PowerShell because of the new rule we created in the Network Security Group. 
</p>
<br />

<p>
<img width="1500" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-27 at 3 40 38‚ÄØPM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a8e85b7f-b238-4525-8483-96a6df877a8c" />

<img width="1587" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-27 at 3 42 45‚ÄØPM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c0d1d35c-9920-4032-ab15-b4895edae0ac" />
</p>

<p>
- Go back and delete the security rule we created. Click the trash can to the right of the rule. Click "Yes" to confirm. Pings should no longer time out, go back to the windows-vm and observe PowerShell and the network traffic in Wireshark. Notice how Wireshark shows requests and replies again and PowerShell is showing replies from 10.0.0.5 again!
</p>

<br />

<h3>Step 4: Observe the SSH and DHCP traffic</h3>
<p>
 <img width="1624" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-27 at 4 05 38‚ÄØPM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5d197381-36e8-4e71-8b23-07bc10a97643" />
<img width="1620" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-27 at 4 11 49‚ÄØPM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/934bf7e1-d655-4378-bc82-b17431188561" />
</p>

<p>
- Now let's observe SSH Traffic. In Wireshark, type ssh into the filter bar and start a new network traffic capture. 
</p>
<p>
- In PowerShell, we will create a secure connection to the linux-vm using the command ssh username@PrivateIP.(username and Private IP of the linux-vm) Example = ssh ajowyit@10.0.0.5 and press enter. 
</p>
<p>
- It will ask if are you sure. Type yes and press enter again. Then enter the password of the linux-vm. As you type in the password, it will remain blank. Type in the password and press enter.
</p>
<p>
- We now have a secure and encrypted connection between the windows-vm and linux-vm, notice the encrypted packets in Wireshark!
</p>
<p>
- Observe the outputs in PowerShell with the id, hostname, and uname -a commands.
</p>


<br />

<p>
 <img width="1621" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-27 at 4 30 04‚ÄØPM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f731f6e6-1760-4572-96a9-0a4c7efb0b41" />

</p>

<p>
- We are done observing SSH traffic. Type the command exit and press enter in PowerShell to close the ssh connection to the linux-vm. Next, let's observe DHCP traffic. 
</p>
<br />

<p>
 <img width="754" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-27 at 5 43 16‚ÄØPM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ed8c56b1-1b2f-4de2-b7c0-689b2e39f765" />

 <img width="1266" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-27 at 5 42 15‚ÄØPM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3682a835-9689-478e-b8d9-b6618329d019" />

</p>

<p>
- Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a protocol used to assign dynamic IP addresses to devices. In Microsoft Azure, virtual machines are assigned reserved dynamic IPs via DHCP. 
</p>

<p>
- When we release an IP address manually with the command ipconfig /release, it can disconnect our RDP session. In order to circumvent this, we will create a batch script that will automate release and renew operations.
</p>

<p>
- Type dhcp into the filter bar of Wireshark and start a new capture. Open Notepad in the windows-vm and write:
</p>

```plaintext
ipconfig /release
ipconfig /renew
```

<br />
<p>
 <img width="1625" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-27 at 5 47 26‚ÄØPM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/785fd98c-d830-4d5e-bffb-8249a5671df4" />
</p>

<p>
- We saved our file in Documents, so in Powershell, cd into the Documents directory. Type the command cd Documents and press enter. Now execute the file with the command .\dhcp.bat in PowerShell. 
</p>

<p>
- You will see the ipconfig /release and the windows-vm will disconnect for a second, but it will fire back up pretty quick once the windows-vm renews the IP. During execution, the VM will momentarily release and renew its IP address. This activity will be captured as DHCP discover, offer, request, and acknowledgment packets in Wireshark. Observe Wireshark and PowerShell in Figure 27. We can see  proccess in action!
</p>
<br />

<h3>Step 5: Observe the DNS and RDP Traffic</h3>
<p>
<img width="1589" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-27 at 6 14 03‚ÄØPM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d3d0c72c-34d3-4258-b7d8-da92cb9e9f97" />
<img width="1704" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-27 at 6 16 14‚ÄØPM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c4024aed-d6d0-4897-8b6a-9c23c66de63f" />
</p>

<p>
- Now let's observe DNS traffic. In the Wireshark filter bar, type in dns and start a new capture. In PowerShell, type in the command nslookup disney.com and press enter. PowerShell should show an IP for disney.com. Copy that IP and paste it into the browser.
</p>

<p>
- Observe the browser. We can see that the IP, 130.211.198.204, is related to Disney somehow. Observe the Disney logo by the IP address. Here are some things to consider. 1) We probably are not authorized to see what this IP really is. 2) DNS protocol translates human-readable domain names into machine-readable IP addresses. Not many websites can be accessed by typing the IP address directly into the address bar of a browser. 
</p>
<br />

<p>
 <img width="771" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-27 at 6 19 03‚ÄØPM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f0e7c222-26c7-4de1-841e-adcaba47e355" />
 <img width="773" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-27 at 6 19 51‚ÄØPM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d98571ed-7871-45ba-8909-ed0761595d5b" />
</p>

<p>
- Finally, let's observe RDP traffic. Filter the traffic by the Port RDP uses (TCP 3389). In the filter bar, type tcp.port==3389. Notice all the packets just zooming through? We saw this same thing at the start of this lab. Because we're running a virtual machine using RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol), there is traffic constantly flowing over the network while we're connected to the windows-vm. Now type rdp in the filter bar and observe.
</p>

<h2>‚úÖ Conclusion</h2>

<p>
In this project, we created two Azure virtual machines‚Äîone running Windows and the other Linux‚Äîto explore real-time network traffic using Wireshark and PowerShell. We successfully connected to the Windows VM via RDP and observed various protocols in action, including ICMP, SSH, DNS, DHCP, and more. By configuring and testing Network Security Groups (NSGs), we gained hands-on experience in managing and securing traffic between cloud-based resources.
</p>
<p>
This lab provided a valuable introduction to cloud networking and traffic analysis, and even gave us a glimpse into the world of cybersecurity through custom NSG rule creation. Whether you're new to Azure or looking to sharpen your skills, exploring tools like Wireshark and PowerShell is a great way to build confidence in real-world IT environments.
</p>
<p>
Thanks for following along‚Äîand don‚Äôt forget to stop (turn off) your VMs to avoid unexpected charges!
